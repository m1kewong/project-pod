# Video Upload & Storage with GCS

This document describes the implementation of the video upload and storage functionality using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for the project-pod application.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed on: June 4, 2025**

All tasks for Step 6 have been completed:

1. ✅ Video file picker and upload logic in Flutter app:
   - Implemented in `client/lib/services/video_upload_service.dart`
   - UI implemented in `client/lib/screens/upload_screen.dart`
   - Uses Firebase Storage which is configured to use GCS buckets

2. ✅ GCS buckets creation:
   - Created `project-pod-dev-uploads` bucket for initial video uploads
   - Created `project-pod-dev-public` bucket for transcoded public videos
   - Additional buckets:
     - `project-pod-dev-public-videos`
     - `project-pod-dev-thumbnails`

3. ✅ Bucket permissions configuration:
   - `uploads` bucket: Private, with access for Firebase and Transcoder service accounts
   - `public` bucket: Publicly readable, with write access for the Transcoder service

4. ✅ Testing:
   - Successfully tested upload functionality to both buckets
   - Verified public accessibility of files in the public bucket

## Testing Notes

The upload functionality can be tested in two ways:

1. Through the Flutter app:
   - The upload screen in the app uses the `video_upload_service.dart` to handle video uploads
   - Authentication has been temporarily bypassed for testing purposes

2. Using gcloud commands:
   ```powershell
   # Upload a file to the uploads bucket
   gcloud storage cp [LOCAL_FILE_PATH] gs://project-pod-dev-uploads/

   # Upload a file to the public bucket
   gcloud storage cp [LOCAL_FILE_PATH] gs://project-pod-dev-public/

   # List files in a bucket
   gcloud storage ls gs://project-pod-dev-uploads/
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Re-enable authentication after completing all upload testing
2. Update the test user creation script with a valid Firebase Admin SDK key
3. Create a proper end-to-end test for the upload functionality
