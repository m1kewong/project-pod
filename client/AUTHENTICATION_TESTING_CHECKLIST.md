# Firebase Authentication Testing Checklist

## Manual Testing Instructions

To thoroughly test the Firebase Authentication implementation, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Firebase project is configured with authentication providers enabled
2. Have test Google account ready
3. Test on iOS device/simulator for Apple Sign-In (or expect proper error on other platforms)
4. Have test email address for email/password testing

### Testing Procedure

#### 1. App Launch & Initial State
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Splash screen displays properly
- [ ] If no user is logged in, redirects to login screen
- [ ] If user is logged in, redirects to home screen

#### 2. Anonymous Browsing
- [ ] Tap "Continue as Guest" on login screen
- [ ] User can browse video feed without authentication
- [ ] Home screen shows video feed tab accessible
- [ ] Upload and Profile tabs show login prompts when tapped
- [ ] Video player allows sharing (public action)
- [ ] Video player prompts for login on Like/Comment/Save

#### 3. Email Registration
- [ ] Navigate to registration mode on login screen
- [ ] Enter valid display name, email, and password
- [ ] Registration succeeds and creates Firestore user document
- [ ] User is redirected to home screen
- [ ] Profile screen shows correct user information

#### 4. Email Login
- [ ] Return to login screen (sign out first)
- [ ] Enter correct email and password
- [ ] Login succeeds and user redirected to home
- [ ] Test with incorrect password - shows appropriate error
- [ ] Test with non-existent email - shows appropriate error

#### 5. Google Sign-In
- [ ] Tap "Continue with Google" button
- [ ] Google account selection appears
- [ ] Select account and complete authentication
- [ ] User profile created/updated in Firestore
- [ ] Profile information (name, photo) populated from Google

#### 6. Apple Sign-In
- [ ] On iOS/macOS: Tap "Continue with Apple" button
- [ ] Apple ID authentication flow appears
- [ ] Complete authentication
- [ ] User profile created in Firestore
- [ ] On other platforms: Shows proper error message

#### 7. Protected Actions Testing
- [ ] As anonymous user, try to upload video - redirected to login
- [ ] As anonymous user, try to like video - login dialog appears
- [ ] As anonymous user, try to comment - login dialog appears
- [ ] As anonymous user, try to save video - login dialog appears
- [ ] As authenticated user, all actions work without prompts

#### 8. Sign Out
- [ ] Navigate to Profile screen
- [ ] Tap "Sign Out" button
- [ ] User signed out successfully
- [ ] Redirected to login screen
- [ ] Authentication state properly reset

#### 9. Error Handling
- [ ] Test with no internet connection - appropriate error messages
- [ ] Test with weak password during registration
- [ ] Test with already registered email
- [ ] Test with invalid email format
- [ ] Verify all error messages are user-friendly

#### 10. Auth Test Screen
- [ ] Access via menu in home screen (three dots menu)
- [ ] Test all authentication methods through dedicated test interface
- [ ] Verify authentication state updates in real-time
- [ ] Test error scenarios through test interface

### Expected Results

#### User Profile in Firestore
After successful authentication, verify the user document contains:
```json
{
  "uid": "user-unique-id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "displayName": "User Name",
  "photoURL": "profile-photo-url",
  "isAnonymous": false,
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp", 
  "lastLoginAt": "timestamp",
  "videoCount": 0,
  "followerCount": 0,
  "followingCount": 0,
  "likeCount": 0,
  "bio": "",
  "website": "",
  "location": "",
  "deviceToken": "",
  "settings": {
    "notifications": true,
    "darkMode": false,
    "privateAccount": false
  },
  "accountType": "standard",
  "joinDate": "timestamp"
}
```

#### Navigation Behavior
- **Anonymous users**: Can access video feed, prompted for login on protected actions
- **Authenticated users**: Full access to all features
- **Login prompts**: Clear, user-friendly dialogs with "Sign In" and "Cancel" options

#### Error Messages
All error messages should be user-friendly versions of technical errors:
- "No account found with this email." instead of "user-not-found"
- "Incorrect password. Please try again." instead of "wrong-password"
- "An account already exists with this email." instead of "email-already-in-use"

### Test Environments
- [ ] Android device/emulator
- [ ] iOS device/simulator (for Apple Sign-In)
- [ ] Various network conditions
- [ ] Different screen sizes

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Authentication flows complete within reasonable time
- [ ] No memory leaks during sign in/out cycles
- [ ] UI remains responsive during authentication
- [ ] Proper loading states displayed

### Security Verification
- [ ] User tokens properly managed by Firebase SDK
- [ ] No sensitive data logged in console
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts
- [ ] Proper cleanup on sign out

## Automated Testing Considerations

For future automated testing, consider implementing:
1. Unit tests for AuthService methods
2. Widget tests for authentication screens
3. Integration tests for complete authentication flows
4. Mock Firebase Auth for testing offline scenarios

## Issues to Monitor

- Apple Sign-In availability detection
- Google Sign-In account selection handling
- Network connectivity edge cases
- Firebase service availability
- User data sync timing
